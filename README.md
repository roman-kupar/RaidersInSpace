# Raiders in Space
### Introduction
The game I'm developing by my own using C++ and SFML library. It uses almost all of the basic instruments provided by SFML: audio, graphics, events handling and etc.
### Structure
Source code of the game follows usual SFML code templates: main.cpp - is an entry point, where the instance of Game is created, game.cpp - game loop, which starts and terminates by player, world.cpp - game engine, which defines and combines all entities into one space. 
### Concept
Game starts with the start screen: animated background and buttons, such: Exit, Options, Play. Options is still in development. It should give player possibility to change audio settings and turn on or off the fullscreen mode. With the "Play" button starts a short cutscene (in future more detailed) with animation. Then the player takes control of a spaceship and have to defend himself against the asteroids and enemy spaceships. There is a set of five levels and a boss in the final one. At the end player should get his total score and time as well if he looses, when the HP icon is empty.
### Progress
Game is still in development. Right now I'm working on the end screen and boss stage. Also options and fullscreen mode require much effort. The game should be ready in 2 months.
